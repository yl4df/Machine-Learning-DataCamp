A complete neural network architecture will have a number of other layers that are designed to play a specific role in the overall functioning of the network. Much deep learning research is about how to structure these layers into coherent systems.</p>\n<p>We'll add the following layers:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://keras.io/layers/pooling/#maxpooling2d\"><code>MaxPooling</code></a>. This passes a (2, 2) moving window over the image and downscales the image by outputting the maximum value within the window.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://keras.io/layers/convolutional/#conv2d\"><code>Conv2D</code></a>.

This prevents the model from overfitting, i.e. perfectly remembering each image, by randomly setting 25% of the input units to 0 at each update during training.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://keras.io/layers/core/#flatten\"><code>Flatten</code></a>. As its name suggests, this flattens the output from the convolutional part of the CNN into a one-dimensional feature vector which can be passed into the following fully connected layers.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://keras.io/layers/core/#dense\"><code>Dense</code></a>. Fully connected layer where every input is connected to every output (see image below).</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://keras.io/layers/core/#dropout\"><code>Dropout</code></a>.
